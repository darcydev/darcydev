              I&apos;m Darcy Price, a {age} years&apos; old full-stack developer
              based in Sydney, Australia. I love to build performant and
              beautiful web applications. I&apos;m also passionate about
              building performant, decoupled, testable and maintainable code,
              and have a keen interest in open source and learning new
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my graduating from law school, I worked as a lawyer for two
              years in London. However, a secondment program working to provide
              solar energy solutions overseas, exposed me to the power of
              technology. Within a few months, I had decided to pursue a career
              as a developer, and and was working as a freelance full-stack
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I mostly work with ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP (Laravel), Drupal,
              WordPress, NextJS, Styled Components, NextJS. If you&apos;re work
              with those technologies, shoot at me on{' '}
