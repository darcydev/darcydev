              I&apos;m Darcy Price, a {age} years&apos; old full-stack developer
              based in Sydney, Australia. I love to build fast and delightful
              experiences on the web applications. I&apos;m also passionate
              about building performant, decoupled, testable and maintainable
              code. I also have a keen interested in open source and learning
              new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my graduating from law school, I worked as a lawyer for two
              years in London. However, a secondment program working with an NGO
              in providing technology solutions to implement solar energy in
              India, exposed me to the power of technology. I decided to pursue
              a career as a developer, and within four months I had left a
              career in law and was working as a full-stack developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work heavily with ReactJS, Styled Components, NextJS, Drupal,
              NodeJS, PHP. If you&apos;re work with those technologies, shoot at
              me on{' '}
